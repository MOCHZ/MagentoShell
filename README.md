# MagentoShell
A horrible Magento module for creating a frontend controller to execute commands directly on the backend server of a Magento 1.x site.

## Warning!
This was basically written for a CTF challenge and should under no circumstance be installed on a live system!

## I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS!

## Installation
Create a .tgz file with the name Pwn_Shell-1.0.0.tgz consisting of ONLY the Pwn_Shell-1.0.0/ directory and package.xml
Upload file to the server through the uploader or the appropriate catalogs within the Magento root directory.
