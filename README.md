# MagentoShell
A horrible Magento module for creating a frontend controller to execute commands directly on the backend server of a Magento 1.x site.

## Warning!
This was basically written for a CTF challenge and should under no circumstance be installed on a live system!

## I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS!
